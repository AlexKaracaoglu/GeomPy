# :curly_loop: GeomPy :curly_loop:
Super cool Differential Geometry and Dynamical Systems library in Python

# The Idea
The idea for this started out in the Spring Semester of 2018 while I was taking an Elementary Differential Geometry course. When poking around some other libraries in python, none really provided the functionality that was desired. I knew I needed to be able to construct N-dimensional curves. So this is where I began. Currently working to bring about desired functionality that other packages just do not have. Interest then spread into some fairly basic dynamical systems, so this became added as well.

# What is used
Dependent on the NumPy and SymPy packages, so shoutout to all who work on those

# Objectives
* Expand the code base for what we have now
* Expand to other areas of mathematics where other packages just don't hit yet
