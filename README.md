# :curly_loop: GeomPy :curly_loop:
Super cool mathematics library in Python

# The Idea
The idea for this started out in the Spring Semester of 2018 while I was taking an Elementary Differential Geometry course. When poking around some other libraries in python, none really provided the functionality that was desired. I knew I needed to be able to construct N-dimensional curves. So this is where I began. Currently working to bring about desired functionality that other packages just do not have.

# What is used
Heavily dependent on the NumPy and SymPy packages

# Objectives
* Expand the code base.
* Get a group of people to work on this project and expand to other areas of mathematics
