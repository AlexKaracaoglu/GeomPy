# :curly_loop: GeomPy :curly_loop:
Super cool Differential Geometry and Dynamical Systems library in Python

# The Idea
The idea for this started out in the Spring Semester of 2018 while I was taking a Differential Geometry course. When poking around some other libraries in python, none really provided the functionality that was desired. I knew I needed to be able to construct N-dimensional curves. So this is where I began. Interest then spread into some fairly basic dynamical systems, so this became added as well. Now just working through these and looking to learn some new math and add that in as well.

# What is used
Shoutout to SymPy, SciPy, NumPy, and matplotlib and all who worked on those.

# Objectives
* Expand the code base for what there is now - open to expanding to new areas of interest
* Have fun and learn some new math!

# If you are looking to contribute
We are looking for contributors and want to expand to other areas of interest, no matter what it is. View our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/AlexKaracaoglu/GeomPy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
